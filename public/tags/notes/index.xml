2-Steps Most steps and tips have been covered by reference#1 and reference#2.
3-Good to know Action will build from base url, could use this feature to create different sub domain under github.io. e.g. create a repo called projects to display different projects, this will be added to github.io/prjects
If site deployment is automatically triggered by Github Action, need to notice the time difference between Github server and local time zone.</description>

      <description>Functionality Trick Recovering original array Opearting a diff array In this blog, we will talk about one trick can be used to solve problems to do with frequent addition and subtraction to a subsection of an array - Diff Array.
Functionality Todo with frequent addition and subtraction to a subsection of an array.
e.g. Given array arr, add 1 for elements between arr[0] and arr[3] inclusively, then, substract 3 for elements between arr[2] and arr[5] inclusively, what will be the final arr.</description>

      <title>SWAP Function</title>

      <description>In this blog, we will look into several ways of implementing swap in different ways.
Intermedia Variable int a = 1; int b = 2; int tem = a; a = b; b = temp; Addition and Subtraction int a = 1; int b = 2; a = a+b; b = a-b; a = a-b; Multiplication and Division int a = 1; int b = 2; a = a*b; b = a/b; a = a/b; XOR int a = 1; int b = 2; a = a^b; b = b^a; // b = b^(a^b) = b^a^b = b^b^a = 0^a = a a = a^b; // a = (a^b)^a = a^b^a = a^a^b = 0^b = b </description>

      <description>There are different type of containers in C++ STL. To add a new element into the back of a container, we normally use push_back(). In this blog, we will look into a new way of performing push back - emplace_back(). Background Knowledge Rvalue References: with aim of increasing the efficiency of C++, rvalues are included. It doesn&amp;rsquo;t need to copy the value, the rvalue reference is bound to the value</description>
