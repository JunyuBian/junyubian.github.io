# 2-Steps

Most steps and tips have been covered by reference#1 and reference#2.

# 3-Good to know

Action will build from base url, could use this feature to create different sub domain under github.io. e.g. create a repo called `projects` to display different projects, this will be added to github.io/prjects

If site deployment is automatically triggered by Github Action, need to notice the time difference between Github server and local time zone.
